*I had six bricked Google WiFi pucks. Claude was sure five of them needed a $30 SPI programmer and an older coreboot that nobody publishes. Wasn't. It was a $1 screw and one bash command. Here's what figuring that out actually looked like.*


Working title candidates, in case the one above is too long:

- "How a $1 screwdriver and a $7 cable beat Google's firmware lockout on the AC-1304"
- "The walled Google WiFi puck isn't actually walled, it's just missing flashrom"
- "OpenWrt on Google WiFi (Gale), from a Mac, after Google's auto-updater closed the door"

## tl;dr

I had six discontinued Google WiFi pucks (model AC-1304, codename Gale) and wanted to mesh them with OpenWrt. The first one flashed in twenty minutes following the standard kkestell guide. The other five did the same boot dance, briefly answered ping, then reverted to a purple LED loop. Forum consensus: they're walled by a newer Google firmware that refuses unsigned USB boot. The accepted remedies were a CH341A SPI programmer plus an older coreboot image nobody seems to publish, or "buy more pucks." Neither felt great.

The actual unlock turned out to be a $7 SuzyQ debug cable from a guy on eBay, plus a tiny silver screw on the mainboard. Once you remove the screw and type four commands at a chronos shell over the puck's debug UART, the wall stops existing. I flashed all five remaining pucks in an afternoon.

This post is the story of how I got there, including the three dead-end rabbit holes I went down before noticing the actual answer was right under the screw I was about to leave alone.

## The setup

I have a Verizon FiOS line on Long Island and a stack of old Google WiFi pucks from when those were the cool consumer mesh option. Google killed the Google WiFi app this year, the pucks are EOL, and they only run Google's locked-down ChromeOS-based "Gale" firmware. Stock works fine but has nothing I want: no SQM, no DNS-level adblock, no ssh.

OpenWrt 25.12.4 has been a supported target for this hardware for ages. The published procedure (kkestell's guide, papdee's OpenWrt forum thread, the OpenWrt wiki) is solid:

1. Open the puck, expose an internal switch called SW7.
2. Boot a Chromium-OS-style USB drive that contains the OpenWrt factory image.
3. SSH into it at 192.168.1.1, dd that same factory image onto the internal eMMC, reboot.

I followed it on one puck (the one that lives in my office) and it worked first try. The puck now serves my house as `gw-main` at 192.168.10.1, running cake SQM at 285 down / 285 up against a baseline of 263ms of bufferbloat. Felt great.

Then I tried the same procedure on every other puck I owned. None of them worked. Every single one did the same thing: hold reset, plug power, LED amber, release, press SW7, LED rapid-blue for a couple seconds (depthcharge reading the USB stick), then solid blue for a couple more (kernel loads), then twenty purple blinks, then breathing purple, then reboot, repeat.

I dug. I found the 2026-05-22 entry of the openwrt-on-google-wifi forum thread where someone reports exactly this. The community theory is that pucks left online for years auto-updated to a newer Google firmware that has a stricter signature-enforcement step. Reflashing the factory image via Google's "OnHub Recovery Utility" Chrome extension doesn't help because the extension only ships the latest firmware. Galeforce, the rooted Google fork, gets reverted too. CH341A on the SPI chip would work in theory but you'd need to source an older Gale coreboot, which nobody has published.

I sat with that for a few days. Then I bought the cable.

## The cable

It's called a SuzyQ (sometimes "SuzyQable"). It's a passive USB-A to USB-C adapter with very specific resistors on the CC lines. When you plug the USB-C end into a compatible target's only USB-C port, the resistors put that port into something called "Debug Accessory Mode" and the target exposes itself to the host as a USB device with bulk endpoints for the various on-board debug consoles. Google uses the same trick on Chromebooks, which is why all the documentation you find is Chromebook-centric.

I bought one from a seller called `chocolateloverraj` on eBay for $7.32 shipped. Same person publishes the open hardware design on GitHub as `gsc-debug-board`, with 2,197 sold at the time I ordered. The cable shows up two days later in a tiny envelope and there's something deeply satisfying about a piece of debug hardware that fits in your palm.

The puck only has one USB-C port, which means the SuzyQ is sharing that port with power. The cable provides 500 mA at 5V over the USB-A side, which turns out to be enough to boot the puck on its own. Blue LED, no separate brick needed.

## macOS pretends the cable doesn't exist

Plug SuzyQ into a Mac. Then plug the other end into a Gale puck. Run `ls /dev/cu.*`.

Nothing.

Run `ioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0 | grep "Gale debug"`. There it is, plain as day: `Google Inc. (0x18d1) / "Gale debug" (0x500f)` with three USB interfaces. macOS sees the device. It just refuses to give you a TTY for it.

That's because the Gale's debug interfaces are vendor-class (`bInterfaceClass = 0xFF`), not CDC-ACM. macOS only auto-binds `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` to CDC-ACM. On Linux you'd get `/dev/ttyUSB0` because the kernel has a permissive fallback driver. On macOS you write libusb.

40 lines of pyusb, opened the AP interface, started reading bulk endpoints. The first time I power-cycled the puck with the script running I got the entire vboot boot trace streaming to my terminal:

```

```

That's the entire boot of an already-working puck. Coreboot bootblock, vboot trying to verify a kernel signature, failing because the OpenWrt kernel is dev-signed instead of factory-signed, falling back to hash-only verification, accepting it, handing off to the Marvell (er, Qualcomm IPQ4019, depthcharge was nice enough to correct me on that) SoC's Linux. It even tells me, in a banner at the end, exactly which command I'd want to run from a chronos shell to enable USB-boot of unsigned kernels.

Which is great if you can get to a chronos shell. Which on a walled puck, at this point, I could not.

## The wall, in detail

I attached the SuzyQ to a walled puck instead of a working one. Same boot trace, almost. Different `Product 4FPD3R` for the eMMC. RSA signature verification PASSES outright this time. cmdline has `dm_verity.dev_wait=1` and `drm.trace=0x106`. Different PARTUUID. The cmdline differences are visibly newer-firmware-than-the-puck-that-worked, which matched the community theory.

Then I tried the kkestell SW7 procedure with the puck on a hub instead of SuzyQ (the hub gives me the second USB port I need for the OpenWrt USB stick). Rapid blue, solid blue, purple loop, reboot. Just like the forum says.

But because I now had serial on a parallel rig, I could also watch what was happening on the wire from a third terminal. I ran `ping 192.168.1.1` and got this:

```

64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=35 ttl=64 time=1.291 ms

```

Seven seconds of replies, then nothing, every three minutes. The kernel IS booting. LAN IS coming up. Networking IS working. And then the firmware kills it before SSH ever opens.

Just to be sure the puck wasn't booting fully and I was unlucky on SSH timing, I race-looped ssh against ping for five minutes:

```
race start: Tue May 26 19:52:59 EDT 2026
[8 ping-OK windows across 5 minutes]
ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.1 port 22: Connection refused
ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.1 port 22: Connection refused
[...]
race end: Tue May 26 19:58:00 EDT 2026, 135 attempts, 0 SSH successes
```

`Connection refused` is the giveaway. The kernel is up, the network stack is responding, but `dropbear` hasn't bound port 22 yet. Per OpenWrt's procd startup order, dropbear comes up after networking, and the firmware kills the kernel before procd reaches that step.

So yes, walled. The forum was right, my version was just a more empirical version. Now the question was whether I could do anything about it from a Mac with a $7 cable.

## Three rabbit holes that all dead-ended

I will spare you most of the detail. You can read it in the repo at `docs/ccd-unlock-research.md`. The short version:

**Rabbit hole 1: the SPI bridge.** It turns out the SuzyQ exposes a third USB interface (`bInterfaceSubClass = 0x51`, `USB_SUBCLASS_GOOGLE_SPI`) that's literally a SPI flash programmer over USB. It's the same protocol flashrom's `raiden_debug_spi` driver speaks. If I could enable it, I could dump the puck's coreboot, patch out the signature check, write it back. No CH341A needed. I sent a JEDEC ID read (opcode `0x9F`) through the bridge and got back a defined error code: `status=0x0005`, which means "The SPI bridge is disabled" per the chromiumos headers. The hardware was wired up and working. It was just turned off in software. On a Chromebook you'd flip it on with `gsctool ccd-set FlashAP`, except Gale doesn't expose the `USB_SUBCLASS_GOOGLE_UPDATE` interface that gsctool talks to. Wedge identified, lock still in place.

**Rabbit hole 2: vendor control transfers.** Maybe there was a backdoor request that toggled the bridge. I wrote a fuzzer that swept all 256 bRequest values across four bmRequestType variants on both the device and each interface. 1024 control transfers, every single one returned STALL. Gale's H1 firmware implements zero vendor-specific control handlers. The backdoor door isn't locked, it doesn't exist.

**Rabbit hole 3: the GSC console.** On a Chromebook you'd type `ccd open` at the GSC's own console, which lives on yet another USB interface inside the same device. I checked Gale's USB descriptor. `bNumInterfaces = 3`. The Cr50 GSC console would have been interface 2, between AP and SPI. Gale's H1 has interfaces 0 (EC_PD), 1 (AP), and 3 (SPI). No interface 2. Not hidden, not locked, not there at all. The H1 firmware on Gale is a stripped-down Cr50 that drops the console interface entirely.

At this point I stopped, wrote it all up, and pushed a commit titled "software path exhausted." I told my AI pair that the recipe was "find a screw, get a CH341A, hope for the best."

Then I asked the same AI what a write-protect screw actually does.

## The screw

Chromebooks have an HW write-protect mechanism that ties the SPI flash chip's WP# pin to a screw on the mainboard. Screw in (and its conductive washer bridging some pads) means WP# is asserted means firmware writes blocked. Screw out means writes allowed. The accepted theory was that even if I removed the screw, the SuzyQ SPI bridge would still be locked by CCD, so the screw alone wouldn't help and I'd still need the CH341A. Which is half right.

I opened a puck. Right next to the H1 chip there was a small silver screw with a brass washer that bridged at least three PCB pads. Different from the case screw. Textbook WP setup. I unscrewed it, put it on a piece of tape, replugged the SuzyQ, and re-ran the probe.

SPI bridge: still disabled. So far so expected.

For the hell of it, before giving up, I also tested whether I could write to the UART interfaces. Up till now every write to iface 0 (EC_PD) or iface 1 (AP) had returned `Errno 60: Operation timed out`. I'd been chalking that up to CCD locking those interfaces.

With the screw out:

```
iface 0 (EC_PD): WRITE OK
iface 1 (AP):    WRITE OK
```

Removing the HW write-protect screw didn't unlock the SPI bridge but it did unlock CCD writes on the UART consoles. Which meant I could now type at the AP console. Which is connected to wherever a getty would be running, if a getty was running. Which on a Gale puck in dev mode, it is. I sent `chronos\r` and got back:

```
chronos
No directory, logging in with HOME=/
chronos@localhost $
```

A shell, on a "walled" puck. The exact thing the Developer Console banner had been telling me about for days. I just hadn't been able to type at it.

## The command

The Developer Console banner specifically tells you what to run if you want USB boot of unsigned kernels:

```
If you are having trouble booting a self-signed kernel, you may need to
enable USB booting.  To do so, run the following as root:

    enable_dev_usb_boot
```

I ran it.

```
chronos@localhost $ sudo enable_dev_usb_boot
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator.

    SUCCESS: Booting any self-signed kernel from SSD/USB/SDCard slot is enabled.

    Insert bootable media into USB / SDCard slot and press Ctrl-U in developer
    screen to boot your self-signed image.
```

Then I went to flash. SW7 dance, same puck. Same rapid blue, same solid blue, same purple loop. Five-minute SSH race, zero hits. Identical to before.

The command had lied. The flag hadn't actually been written. I went back to the chronos shell and ran `crossystem` to see what it thought, and every single flag that should have come from vboot NVRAM came back like this:

```
Flashrom invocation failed (exit status 127): flashrom -p host -r -i RW_NVRAM:/tmp/vb2_flashrom.Ae2oKY
backup_nvram_request    = (error)
[...]
Flashrom invocation failed (exit status 127): [...]
dev_boot_usb            = (error)
```

127 is "command not found." The auto-updated Google firmware on this puck doesn't ship the `flashrom` binary in PATH. `crossystem` shells out to flashrom to read and write the RW_NVRAM region of the SPI flash, and when flashrom isn't there, `crossystem` silently reports `(error)` for every NVRAM-backed field. `enable_dev_usb_boot` ALSO shells out to crossystem under the hood, gets the same `(error)`, and prints SUCCESS anyway. Lovely.

So the actual wall, the thing that had been making me think the firmware had a signature watchdog at the kernel-handoff layer, was just a missing binary on the production image plus a script that doesn't check its own return codes.

This is also why kkestell's procedure works on never-online pucks. The original 2017 firmware shipped with flashrom in PATH. The auto-updated newer firmware dropped it, presumably because Google figured no consumer would ever need flashrom on their router.

## The fix that turned out to actually be the fix

Once you know flashrom is missing, the answer is obvious. Reflash the original factory firmware. The version that has flashrom. Then run `enable_dev_usb_boot` from that.

Google publishes the official Gale recovery image at this URL:

```
https://dl.google.com/dl/edgedl/chromeos/recovery/chromeos_9334.41.3_gale_recovery_stable-channel_mp.bin.zip
```

70 MB zip, 1.84 GB extracted, sha1 `3914470f0f3417cbd876c238fe495d65562c4f6e`. Same image the OnHub Recovery Utility Chrome extension would download for you, except now you can just `dd` it. (I tried OnHub Recovery first. It refused to install on Chrome 131 with some opaque manifest error. The direct URL works.)

So the recipe became:

1. Open the case, find the WP screw, remove it. The washer is the giveaway, it bridges multiple pads.
2. Write the Gale recovery image to a USB stick. `sudo dd if=chromeos_9334.41.3_gale_recovery_stable-channel_mp.bin of=/dev/rdisk4 bs=1m conv=sync`. The `conv=sync` matters because the file isn't a multiple of 512 bytes and rdisk on macOS rejects partial sector writes.
3. Plug the USB stick into a USB-C PD hub, plug the puck into the hub, hold the puck's external reset button while connecting, release at amber LED, wait five minutes for solid blue. Now you have a fresh factory ChromeOS install with flashrom present.
4. Unplug from the hub. Plug the SuzyQ between the puck and your Mac. Hold reset, plug SuzyQ, release at amber, press SW7, wait three seconds, press SW7 again. That puts the puck in recovery mode, the second SW7 press confirms "yes, enable dev mode," the TPM stores the flag, the puck cold-reboots into dev mode.
5. Wait three to five minutes. ChromeOS does a first-boot-in-dev-mode powerwash that recreates the stateful partition. The puck will cycle through the boot a few times in this period and the `localhost login:` prompt will flash on the serial console for a second each cycle before disappearing. Resist the urge to type. If you type `chronos` during this period, depthcharge interprets the keypresses as menu navigation and you'll accidentally toggle dev mode back off and have to redo the SW7 dance. (Ask me how I know.)
6. Once `localhost login:` sticks (stays on screen instead of flashing), send `chronos\r` and you get a shell with no password.
7. Run:
   ```
   sudo enable_dev_usb_boot
   sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1 dev_boot_signed_only=0 dev_default_boot=usb
   ```
   Confirm with `sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb` returning `1`.
8. From here it's the standard kkestell flow. Write OpenWrt's `factory.bin` to the same USB stick, swap from SuzyQ back to the hub, SW7 dance, USB-boots OpenWrt steady-blue this time, no purple revert. `scp -O factory.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/`, `dd if=/dev/zero bs=512 seek=7634911 of=/dev/mmcblk0 count=33`, `dd if=/tmp/...factory.bin of=/dev/mmcblk0 && sync && reboot`. Pull the USB stick, wait thirty seconds, boots OpenWrt from internal eMMC. Done.

About ten minutes per puck if you stay focused. I flashed five walled pucks back-to-back this way and they all worked first try. The factory recovery flash is the slow step at five minutes. The SW7 dance plus chronos login plus the four commands is maybe two minutes. Everything else is cable swapping and waiting for the LED to settle.

## What I tested to make sure no step was unnecessary

I was paranoid about publishing a procedure that's a superset of what actually works (the AI was happily writing me long recipes that might or might not have included redundant steps). So on the fourth puck I did A/B tests on the two steps that seemed most "maybe this is just superstition."

**Did I really need to remove the WP screw?** Tried chronos login with the screw still installed. Both UART interfaces (EC_PD and AP) returned `Errno 60: Operation timed out` on every write attempt. Without the screw out you cannot type at the puck. So yes, the screw has to come out.

**Did I really need to reflash factory firmware?** Tried skipping that step on the same puck (WP screw out, SW7 dance to enable dev mode, straight to chronos login attempt). ChromeOS got stuck in the powerwash cycle, never stabilizing at `localhost login:`. I waited 12 minutes; the login prompt flashed on screen during each boot cycle but Linux rebooted before chronos shell could finish setup. Hypothesis: the auto-updated image is missing not just flashrom but other components the dev-mode powerwash flow needs to complete. After running the factory recovery flash, powerwash completes in 3-5 minutes and chronos sticks.

Two confirmed-necessary steps, no shortcuts found. There may still be a shortcut for pucks that were never online, in which case the firmware never auto-updated and flashrom is still present and you can skip the recovery flash. I don't have an offline-since-2017 puck to test on. If you do, try the chronos shell on the original firmware after just removing the WP screw and the SW7 dance, before doing the recovery flash. Let me know.

## Things that surprised me

The whole thing was supposed to be a serial-console story. I bought the cable because I wanted to watch the boot and figure out why my Mac wasn't getting an ethernet link to a USB-booted OpenWrt puck. The walled-puck unlock was a side quest that ate the main quest.

The wall isn't a firmware-policy wall. It's a missing-binary wall, which is much dumber and much more fixable. Three rabbit holes (SPI bridge, control transfer fuzz, GSC console hunt) all dead-ended at "this would be the right way to do this on a Chromebook, but Gale doesn't expose the interface." All three rabbit holes were necessary to convince me that the unlock had to be hardware-flavored, which is the only reason I bothered looking at the WP screw. So they weren't wasted, exactly. They were just looking in the wrong drawer.

The HW write-protect screw doing double duty as a CCD-UART unlock was not in any documentation I could find. MrChromebox describes WP screw removal in the context of unbricking with a CH341A. The chromium hdctools docs mention CCD UART access as a capability you flip on with `gsctool` (which Gale doesn't have). Nobody in the documentation I read said "hey, on this device, the screw also unlocks the UART writes." It's possible this is well-known in the Chromebook hacking community and I just didn't find the right thread. If you know more about this, I'd love to hear from you.

`enable_dev_usb_boot` printing SUCCESS while silently failing is a UX choice. I get why the script doesn't want to scare you, but a non-zero exit code when the underlying crossystem call returned (error) would have saved me about two hours.

## Code and notes

Everything is at [github.com/jconnolly/google-wifi-suzyq-console-macos](https://github.com/jconnolly/google-wifi-suzyq-console-macos):

- `tools/gale-sniff-all` is the read-only serial sniffer with auto-reconnect across power cycles. The auto-reconnect matters because the SuzyQ also powers the puck so power-cycling drops the USB device.
- `tools/gale-spi-probe` and `tools/gale-ctrl-fuzz` are the diagnostic tools from rabbit holes 1 and 2. Neither is necessary for the actual flashing, they're there to document what doesn't work.
- `docs/unlock-walled-puck.md` is the recipe in tutorial form.
- `docs/flashing.md` covers the standard kkestell flow (what works on never-walled pucks) with notes on what the serial trace looks like at each step.
- `captures/` has full serial traces from the entire journey, walled and unwalled, organized per session. The `flash-session-20260526-1913/` directory in particular shows the wall in action and the eventual unlock.

If you have walled Gale pucks of your own and want to mesh them, the recipe will probably just work. If you have older firmware pucks, none of this is needed and you can follow kkestell's original guide. If you're on Linux and your `/dev/ttyUSB*` shows up the moment you plug the SuzyQ in, please send me a thank-you photo, I was very jealous.
